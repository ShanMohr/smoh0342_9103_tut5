## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration 

For this weeks quiz I found it very interesting researching design inspirations, but my mind kept coming back to a music video I have always found intriguing but its simplicity yet story telling narrative.

My imaging technique inspiration comes from the _Gotye “somebody That I Use to Know” music video_. 

The **stop-motion and painting technique** inspires my approach to visual storytelling. 

I am drawn to how the artists blend into the geometric backdrop, sort of like the rectangles with the Mona Lisa we coded in class. 

I want to incorporate a similar visual metaphor in my project where the image fades into or emerges from the digital canvas.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration 

To replicate the gradual paint-filling and outline effects seen in Gotye's music video, I’ll explore **SVG line drawing animation using stroke-dashoffset and stroke-dasharray combined with Javascript-triggered hover fill**. 

This technique enables the outlines of shapes to gradually appear over time creating the illusion that they are being hand drawn in real time. 

When the user interacts, hovering over the shapes, the shapes can then be filled with color simulating the effect of painted surfaces coming to life. 

This layered visual technique mimics the stop-motion painting style used in Gotye’s music video, where the subject becomes visually absorbed into geometric artwork. 

The result creates an engaging storytelling experience conveyed through animated illustration.

> Conclusion for Week 9 Quiz

## Conclusion

Exploring the visual storytelling in Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used to Know” and translating its stop-motion paiting interactive SVG animation has inspired new ways to communicate behavial shifts in artwork. 

By combining SVG line drawing and JavaScript triggered color fills by mouse hovering, I can create a meaningful visual artwork that reflects user interaction into the group project.
